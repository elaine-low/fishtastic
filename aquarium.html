         <h1><b>Moorish idol fish</b></h1>
		<p>Scientific Name:</p>
		<p>Zanclus cornutus (Linnaeus, 1758)

		<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>The distribution of this species includes the warm tropical water from Hawai'i to Australia, and from the west coast of Central America westward to the coast of Africa and the Red Sea.</p> 
<h4>Maximum Size:</h4>
<p>To 9".</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>The best environment for this fish is to provide it with lots of swimming room to move around unobstructed, and plenty of cover and hiding places. Because it is a very easily frightened fish and rather unpredictable in its compatibility nature, these provisions are important.</p>
<h4>Minimum Tank Size Suggested:</h4>
<p>100 gallons.</p>
<h4>Reef Tank Suitability:</h4>
<p>The Moorish Idol is an omnivore. Its preferred food sources are sponge, small crustacean and invertebrate life, and some marine algae. The Moorish Idol is a grazer and spends its day cruising and picking. Sometimes an individual may nip at large polyped stony corals and some types of soft coral polyps.</p>
<h4>Characteristics & Compatibility:</h4>
<p>The Moorish Idol is compatible with most other fish. If more than one Idol is to be housed in one tank, they should be introduced to the tank at the same time.</p>
<h4>Diet & Feeding:</h4>
<p>This fish should be fed several times a day, with a varied diet of finely chopped dried, fresh or frozen meaty fares such as shrimp, squid, clams, and live mysid shrimp or vitamin enriched brine shrimp, as well as vegetable matter suitable for herbivores. Because sponge is one of this fish's main natural food sources, provide prepared fares that include sponge in them.</p>



<h1><b>Copperband butterflyfish</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Chelmon rostratus.</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>Beaked Butterflyfish, Beaked Coralfish, or Orange Stripe Butterfly.</p>
<h4>Maximum Size:</h4>
<p>7.9".</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>Indo-west-Pacific.</p>
<h4>Diet:</h4>
<p>The Copperband Butterfly may be difficult to get to eat in an aquarium. Feeding live (fresh clams or mussels with their shells broken open), frozen foods (Mysis Shrimp or carnivore preparations) or marine fish and crustaceans to begin with seems to be the best bet to get them to begin feeding.</p>
<h4>Reef Tank Suitability:</h4>
<p>The Copperband is generally safe with soft and small-polyped stony corals. Some specimens may nip at large-polyped stony corals, certain soft corals and zoanthids. Most of them will consume Aiptasia and polychaete worms.</p>
<h4>Characteristics:</h4>
<p>This fish is fairly sensitive, so poor treatment during capture, transport and holding will greatly determine how well it will fare in your tank. Close inspection of the fish's condition, as well as observing it eat before purchasing will greatly improve its odds of survival.</p>
<h4>Minimum Tank Size:</h4>
<p>55 gallon.</p>



<h1><b>Clown fish</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Amphiprion ocellaris (Cuvier, 1830)</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>False Clown Anemonefish.</p>
<h4>Identification:</h4>
<p>Normally bright orange with three white bars, the middle one with forward-projecting bulge; bars have narrow black margins.</p>
<h4>Distribtution:</h4>
<p>Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
<p>To 3.5 inches.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>Provide with plenty of hiding places and live rock growth for grazing on.</p>
<h4>Minimum Tank Size Suggested:</h4>
<p>20 gallons</p>
<h4>Reef Tank Suitability:</h4>
<p>Excellent fish for a reef tank environment.</p>
<h4>Preferred Host Anemone Species:</h4>
<p>Heteractis magnifica; Stichodactyla gigantea; S. mertensii. This fish also does fine without a host anemone.</p>
<h4>Characteristics & Compatibility:</h4>
<p>Gets along well with most other species, including other Clownfish.</p>
<h4>Diet & Feeding: </h4>
<p>An omnivore which should have a varied diet including meaty food items and algae. A high quality marine omnivore flake food with these items can supply adequate levels of these nutrients. Feed 2 to 3 times per day.</p>



<h1><b>Pacific blue tang</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Paracanthurus hepatus (Linnaeus, 1766).</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>Hippo Tang, Blue Regal Tang, and Palette Surgeonfish. Also recognized and known as "Dory", the fish in the Disney movie Finding Nemo.</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>Native to reefs across the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
<p>12.2 inches (31 cm).</p>
<h4>Characteristics and Compatibility:</h4>
<p>Not overly aggressive towards other tank mates, but may become boisterous in the community. Juveniles can be kept together in groups, but adults will fight unless ample shelter and swimming room is provided. Prone to contracting ich, and susceptible to head and lateral line erosion (HLLE), like most Surgeonfishes are.</p>
<h4>Diet and Feeding:</h4>
<p>Unlike most tangs or surgeonfishes that require a steady diet of algae, the Pacific Blue Tang should also be fed meaty fares to satisfy its zooplankton dietary needs. Finely chopped fresh or frozen shrimp, mysid shrimp, brine shrimp, and preparations for herbivores are suitable foods, as well as nori (dried seaweed) is accepted. To help with healing of HLLE problems, foods can be soaked in a liquid vitamin supplement, such as Selcon, and Kent Marine Zoecon.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>A fish that is very active, it should be provided with plenty of room to move around, and an ample supply of live rock to graze on at its leisure is beneficial.</p>
<h4>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:</h4>
<p>100 gallons (379 L).</p>
<h4>Reef Tank Suitability:</h4>
<p>Good.</p>



<h1><b>Fantail Goldfish</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Carassius auratus</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>Show Goldfish, Fancy Goldfish</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>originated in Asia; Central Asia (Siberia). They inhabit the slow moving and stagnant waters of rivers, lakes, ponds, and ditches feeding on plants, detritus, small crustaceans, and insects.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
 <p>6.0 inches (15.24 cm)</p>
<h4>Characteristics and Compatibility:</h4>
<p>Goldfish are very social animals and thrive in a community. Not only are they a great community fish, but they are great scavengers as well. The Fantail Goldfish, along with the Ryukins, are some of the only egg-shaped goldfish that can readily compete for food with elongated goldfish, such as the Common or Shubunkin Goldfish. As such, the Fantail Goldfish makes a suitable tankmate for any of those. It is really not necessary to add other scavengers or other bottom feeders to the aquarium when you have goldfish.</p>

<p>Most fancy goldfish will thrive in both freshwater and tropical aquariums as long as there are no aggressive or territorial fish in the tank. Some good tankmates for fancy goldfish are the Chinese Blue Bitterling and the Northern Redbelly Dace.</p>
<h4>Diet and Feeding:</h4>
<p>Since they are omnivorous, the Fantail Goldfish will generally eat all kinds of fresh, frozen, and flake foods. To keep a good balance, give them a high quality flake food everyday. To care for your goldfish, feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen), blood worms, Daphnia, or tubifex worms as a treat. It is usually better to feed freeze-dried foods as opposed to live foods to avoid parasites and bacterial infections that could be present in live foods.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>These goldfish are hardy and easy to keep in a well-maintained tank. Minimum tank size is 10 gallons, but make sure water changes are frequent in such as small tank. Regular weekly water changes of 1/4 to 1/3 are strongly recommended to keep these fish healthy. Snails can be added as they reduce the algae in the tank, helping to keep it clean.</p>
Suggested Minimum Tank Size:
<p>10gal</p>



<h1><b>Guppies</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Poecilia reticulata</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>Fancy Guppy, Millions Fish</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>They are widely distributed in Southern and Central America, specifically Venezuela, Barbados, Trinidad, Brazil and the Guyanas. 
There is a great deal of color diversity within the species, and it breeds readily and quickly. There is also a diverse range of variations in the tail fin, including Sword and Double Sword varieties, Roundtail, Pintail, Flagtail, and the ever popular Fantail variety.</p>
<p>They occur in a wide variety of habitats, but are usually found in waters that are quiet and densely vegetated. They can tolerate a wide salinity range and water temperatures ranging from 64-82° F (18-28° C). These fish often live in shoals in the wild.They feed on detritus with algae and plant matter and also consume zooplankton, diatoms, invertebrates, small insects, and insect larvae.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
<p>2.4 inches (5.99 cm)</p>
<h4>Characteristics and Compatibility:</h4>
<p>The Guppy is extremely active but also very friendly. This fish has a very kind and even temperament and is generally peaceful and active.This sociable fish combines well with all other good-natured fish. Small fishes such as armored catfish (Corydoras), Platy fish, Tetras and other Characins make good tankmates.</p>
<p>These active fish form loose schools and are always on the move. Though they are peaceful community fish and easily kept with other livebearers, they may chase fry and will often nip the fins of the Betta or Siamese Fighting Fish. The aquarist should avoid combining the Guppy with the Betta, particularly in small quarters, as one of the two or both are bound to get their fins shredded.</p>
<h4>Diet and Feeding:</h4>
<p>Since they are omnivorous, the Guppy will generally eat all kinds of fresh, frozen, and flake foods. In the wild, their diet consists of detritus with algae and plant matter, zooplankton, diatoms, invertebrates, small insects, and insect larvae.
In the aquarium, they will gladly eat most commercially-prepared fish foods as well as supplementary live and vegetable-based food. Feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen) or blood worms as a treat. Baby brine shrimp are a favorite of this species. This fish is not a picky eater but should be fed a varied diet several times daily in very small amounts.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>Fancy Guppies do not require special aquarium care and are not too demanding about their tank. Still, the tank should have regular water changes of 25% two to three times a month, depending how many fish it holds and the condition of the water.
As in caring for most of this family, aquarists should add 1-1.25 teaspoons of aquarium salt per gallon. When changing water, replace salted water with salted water, but when replacing water that has evaporated, do not add additional salt. Water that evaporates will leave salts behind, so there is no need to add more salt if you are topping off evaporated water.</p>
<h4>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:</h4>
<p>5 gal </p>




<h1><b>Neon Tetra</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Paracheirodon innesi</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>They are found in South America in the Paraguay River basin, Rio Taquari, Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul, and Brazil.
In nature, these fish inhabit the slow-moving tributaries of main rivers. Neon Tetras live in shoals mainly in the middle water layers and feed on worms and small crustaceans.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
<p>1.6 inches (3.99 cm)</p>
<h4>Characteristics and Compatibility:</h4>
<p>Neon Tetras are ideal for a community aquarium with other peaceful fish. It is best not to keep them with fish that are larger or aggressive, like angels. Good tankmates include other small tetras, hatchet fish, pencil fish, Corydoras, smaller rasboras, and peaceful barbs. They are most comfortable and show their best colors when kept in a school of 6 or more fish.</p>
<h4>Diet and Feeding:</h4>
<p>Since they are omnivorous, Neon Tetras will generally eat all kinds of small or finely ground foods--live, fresh, and flake. To keep a good balance, give them a high quality flake food every day. Feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen) or blood worms as a treat. These tetras like several feedings a day, but offer only what they can consume in 3 minutes or less at each feeding.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>The Neon Tetra is active and does best in a school with 6 or more of its own kind. A school will be comfortable in a 10-gallon aquarium.They should have peat-filtered water. These fish also prefer to have a bit of a current to swim in.Dim lighting will develop this tetra's best coloring.</p>
<p>These fish prefer some plant cover and a darker gravel. A biotype setup is a great choice for this tetra and is very easy to put together. For the substrate, use a river sand with some drift wood and twisted roots. Add some dried leaves to the tank, which will stain the water a light brown, and replace the leaves every few weeks.</p>
<h4>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:</h4>
<p>10gal</p>



<h1><b>Oranda Goldfish</b></h1>
<p>Scientific Name:</p>
<p>Carassius auratus auratus</p>
<h4>Other Common Names:</h4>
<p>Oranda Fancy Goldfish</p>
<h4>Distribution:</h4>
<p>These wild carp originated in Asia; Central Asia (Siberia). They inhabit the slow moving and stagnant waters of rivers, lakes, ponds, and ditches feeding on plants, detritus, small crustaceans, and insects.
The Oranda Goldfish is one of the older varieties of fancy goldfish. Today, domesticated goldfish are distributed world-wide. The Oranda is one of the more than 125-captive bred fancy goldfish varieties.</p>
<h4>Average Size:</h4>
<p>7.0 inches (17.78 cm)</p>
<h4>Characteristics and Compatibility:</h4>
<p>Goldfish are very social animals and thrive in a community. Not only are they a great community fish but they are great scavengers as well. It is really not necessary to add other scavengers or other bottom feeders to the aquarium when you have goldfish.
The Oranda Goldfish is not a fast swimmer, so it cannot vigorously compete for food with fast swimming types of goldfish like the Common Goldfish, Comet Goldfish, and the Shubunkin. The Oranda may not fare well if housed with these fish, but it does well with other egg-shaped varieties, if its environment is well cared for.</p>
<h4>Diet and Feeding:</h4>
<p>Since they are omnivorous, the Oranda Goldfish will generally eat all kinds of fresh, frozen, and flake foods. To keep a good balance give them a high quality flake food everyday. To care for your Oranda Goldfish, feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen), blood worms, Daphnia, or tubifex worms as a treat. It is usually better to feed freeze-dried foods as opposed to live foods to avoid parasites and bacterial infections that could be present in live foods. Due to their fleshy head growth they can have poor vision and a harder time seeing their food, so need extra time to feed.</p>
<h4>Habitat:</h4>
<p>Setting up a goldfish aquarium in a manner that will keep your fish happy and healthy is the first step to success. The shape and size of the aquarium is important and depends upon the number of goldfish you are going to keep. These fish need a lot of oxygen and produce a lot of waste. Good filtration, especially biological filtration, is very helpful in maintaining the water quality of the aquarium. A filtration system will remove much of the detritus, excess foods, and waste, which keeps the tank clean and maintains the general health of the goldfish</p>
<h4>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:</h4>
<p>10gal</p>
