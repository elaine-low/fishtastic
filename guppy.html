              <h4>Scientific Name:Poecilia reticulata</h4>
              </section>

              <h4>Other Common Names</h4>
              <p>Fancy Guppy, Millions Fish</p>
              <p>Average Size:2.4 inches (5.99 cm)</p>
              <h4>Distribution</h4>
              <p>They are widely distributed in Southern and Central America, specifically Venezuela, Barbados, Trinidad, Brazil and the Guyanas. 
              There is a great deal of color diversity within the species, and it breeds readily and quickly. 
              There is also a diverse range of variations in the tail fin, including Sword and Double Sword varieties, Roundtail, Pintail, Flagtail, and the ever popular Fantail variety.
              They occur in a wide variety of habitats, but are usually found in waters that are quiet and densely vegetated. 
              They can tolerate a wide salinity range and water temperatures ranging from 64-82° F (18-28° C). 
              These fish often live in shoals in the wild.
              They feed on detritus with algae and plant matter and also consume zooplankton, diatoms, invertebrates, small insects, and insect larvae.</p>
              <h4>Characteristics and Compatibility</h4>
              <p>The Guppy is extremely active but also very friendly. This fish has a very kind and even temperament and is generally peaceful and active.
              This sociable fish combines well with all other good-natured fish. 
              Small fishes such as armored catfish (Corydoras), Platy fish, Tetras and other Characins make good tankmates.
              These active fish form loose schools and are always on the move. Though they are peaceful community fish and easily kept with other livebearers, 
              they may chase fry and will often nip the fins of the Betta or Siamese Fighting Fish. 
              The aquarist should avoid combining the Guppy with the Betta, particularly in small quarters, as one of the two or both are bound to get their fins shredded.</p>
              <p>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:5 gallons</p>
              <h4>Diet and Feeding</h4>
              <p>Since they are omnivorous, the Guppy will generally eat all kinds of fresh, frozen, and flake foods. 
              In the wild, their diet consists of detritus with algae and plant matter, zooplankton, diatoms, invertebrates, small insects, and insect larvae. 
              In the aquarium, they will gladly eat most commercially-prepared fish foods as well as supplementary live and vegetable-based food. 
              Feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen) or blood worms as a treat. Baby brine shrimp are a favorite of this species. 
              This fish is not a picky eater but should be fed a varied diet several times daily in very small amounts.</p>
              <h4>Habitat</h4>
              <p>Fancy Guppies do not require special aquarium care and are not too demanding about their tank. Still, 
              the tank should have regular water changes of 25% two to three times a month, depending how many fish it holds and the condition of the water.
              As in caring for most of this family, aquarists should add 1-1.25 teaspoons of aquarium salt per gallon. 
              When changing water, replace salted water with salted water, but when replacing water that has evaporated, do not add additional salt. 
              Water that evaporates will leave salts behind, so there is no need to add more salt if you are topping off evaporated water.</p>
