              <h4>Other Common Names</h4>
              <p>Oranda Fancy Goldfish</p>
              <p>Average Size:7.0 inches (17.78 cm)</p>
              <h4>Distribution</h4>
              <p>These wild carp originated in Asia; Central Asia (Siberia). 
              They inhabit the slow moving and stagnant waters of rivers, lakes, ponds, and ditches feeding on plants, detritus, small crustaceans, and insects. 
              The Oranda Goldfish is one of the older varieties of fancy goldfish. Today, domesticated goldfish are distributed world-wide.
              The Oranda is one of the more than 125-captive bred fancy goldfish varieties.</p>
              <h4>Characteristics and Compatibility</h4>
              <p>Goldfish are very social animals and thrive in a community. Not only are they a great community fish but they are great scavengers as well. 
              It is really not necessary to add other scavengers or other bottom feeders to the aquarium when you have goldfish.
              The Oranda Goldfish is not a fast swimmer, so it cannot vigorously compete for food with fast swimming types of goldfish like the Common Goldfish, 
              Comet Goldfish, and the Shubunkin. 
              The Oranda may not fare well if housed with these fish, but it does well with other egg-shaped varieties, if its environment is well cared for.</p>
              <p>Suggested Minimum Tank Size:10 gallons</p>
              <h4>Diet and Feeding</h4>
              <p>Since they are omnivorous, the Oranda Goldfish will generally eat all kinds of fresh, frozen, and flake foods. 
              To keep a good balance give them a high quality flake food everyday. 
              To care for your Oranda Goldfish, feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen), blood worms, Daphnia, or tubifex worms as a treat. 
              It is usually better to feed freeze-dried foods as opposed to live foods to avoid parasites and bacterial infections that could be present in live foods. 
              Due to their fleshy head growth they can have poor vision and a harder time seeing their food, so need extra time to feed.</p>
              <h4>Habitat</h4>
              <p>Setting up a goldfish aquarium in a manner that will keep your fish happy and healthy is the first step to success. 
              The shape and size of the aquarium is important and depends upon the number of goldfish you are going to keep. 
              These fish need a lot of oxygen and produce a lot of waste. 
              Good filtration, especially biological filtration, is very helpful in maintaining the water quality of the aquarium. 
              A filtration system will remove much of the detritus, excess foods, and waste, which keeps the tank clean and maintains the general health of the goldfish</p>
