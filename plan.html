            <ul>
              <li>Do I need to make an appointment?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Generally    patients are seen by appointments but we can accommodate emergencies without    an appointment. If possible please call ahead of time and make an appointment    with us. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What form of payment do you accept?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We accept    Paypal, Visa Debit/Credit Cards and Mastercard Debit/Credit Cards.Payment is    due when services are performed or when your pet leaves the vet. A down    payment is required before emergency treatment is provided. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What if I cannot leave work to bring my pets to    their veterinary appointments?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may drop    off your pet with us in the morning and your pet will be seen during the day.    Once everything is done we will call you afterwards to pick up your pet    anytime from when we call until 9pm on weekdays, 5pm on Saturdays and 2pm on    Sunday. There is no additional charge for drop-off service. Animals not    picked up will stay overnight and a boarding fee will be added. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What kind of animals can you take care of?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We provide    veterinary care for puppies, kittens, dogs, cats, hamsters, rabbits, guinea    pigs and fishes. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What should I do if my pet gets extremely ill or    injured after hours?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Call the    clinic and your call will be transferred to one of our veterinarians on-call.    If emergency care is necessary you are required to make a down payment before    we can provide care for your pet. Full payment is due when your pet is ready    to go home. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How often should I take my pet to the vet?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every pet has    unique medical needs, so you and your vet should discuss an ongoing    healthcare plan for your animal, as your pet may have a condition that    requires relatively frequent visits to treat properly. However, generally    speaking, we recommend bringing a healthy pet in at least once a year for a    wellness visit, to make sure he or she is up to date on his/her shots and    that everything is functioning as it should. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How do I know if my pet is sick?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes    animals hide their illnesses or injuries so it is important to pay attention    and be aware of the signs of symptoms that require immediate urgent emergency    care. If you suspect your pet is unwell please do not hesitate to call us.    Early veterinary attention can prevent serious illnesses from progressing and    reduce the cost of care. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What age can I have my pet spayed or neutered?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Spaying or    neutering can be done at approximately 6 months of age. Your pet is given an    exam prior to surgery to help determine whether your pet is healthy enough to    undergo the surgical procedure. Current vaccinations are required at the time    of surgery. Also a pre-anesthetic blood screen is performed prior to    undergoing anesthesia and surgery. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How long do sutures stay in after my pet&rsquo;s    surgery?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Procedures    involving sutures require them to be removed in 10 &ndash; 14 days following the    surgery. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What breed of dogs need grooming?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All dogs need    their coat and nails tended to, but some dogs require much more grooming than    others. Some breeds that require frequent grooming are Poodles, Shih Tzus and    Lhasa Apsos, Bichon Frises, Yorkshire Terriers, Schnauzers, and West Highland    Terriers. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you board pets?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have    boarding facilities for dogs within our clinic. We encourage you to bring    your pet&rsquo;s own food. If your pet is on any medication, please bring it with    you when you drop your pet off. </p></td>

          <p><strong>Dr. Cathy Chan</strong></p>
          <p>BVSc (Hons) Sydney, Post Grad. Dip. (Vet Clinical Studies),
MANZCVS (Small Animal Medicine)</p>
          <p>Dr. Chan graduated with second class honours in 2003 from the University of Sydney. She worked in private practice in Singapore for 2 years, then made the move overseas to work for the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Sydney. She obtained her memberships in small animal medicine with the Australian College of Veterinary Scientists and completed a Post-Graduate Diploma in Veterinary Clinical Studies. She finally made the move back to Singapore at the end of 2007. She is currently pursuing her Masters in Veterinary Clinical Studies, focusing on retroviral diseases in the cats of Singapore. She was adopted by a beautiful black cat in 2008 and they have not looked back ever since. </p>
          <p>Dr. Dymphna is owned by 2 geriatric cats, one with diabetes, which is why they had to stay at home and not move to Singapore. Luckily they are able to still skype with Dr. Dymphna to make sure she is still helping kitties away from home. </p><br>
          
          <p><strong>Dr. Hollie Gunn</strong></p>
          <p>BVetMed, MRCVS</p>
          <p>Dr. Gunn graduated from the Royal Veterinary College in London and has since worked in the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa. Before moving to Singapore, she ran her own company in the UK, providing locum services to several state-of-the-art veterinary clinics across London. Her interests include internal medicine, in which she is undertaking the advance practitioner certificate, and rabbit medicine – having always had her own bunny until very recently! Dr Hollie arrived in Singapore earlier in 2015, relocating with her partner and rescue Collie-cross named Max – and since arriving has been adopted by a cheeky Singapore Special named Chelsea! </p>
